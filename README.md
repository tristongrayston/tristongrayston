# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Triston!

I'm a 4th-year CS & Math student at UVic. A previous president of the UVicAI club, I've recently stepped back to a more advisory role to pursue my deeper passions. Most things that do justice to the name artificial intelligence fit into that category; generating true intelligence artificially is a fascination of mine. 

ðŸ”­ Some previous projects include:
- Mechanistic Interpretability of Reinforcement Learning Agents.
- Exploration of Deep Learning Architectures as High Fidelity World Models.
- Predicting Wildfire Control with Adversarial Agents.
- The Superresolution of SDSS Spectra with Predictive Latent Models.
- ... And many more!   

ðŸ’¼ I'm actively looking for 2025 co-ops in AI, Data Science, Robotics, ML and Software Engineering roles.
